```

This ensures **you never lose credit** for a completed computation.


## üíæ Download Precompiled Binaries (Linux, Windows & macOS)

You can download **precompiled binaries** for **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS** directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers/releases).

Each release contains:
- A compiled executable: `prmers` (Linux/macOS) or `prmers.exe` (Windows)
- Required OpenCL kernel files inside a `kernels/` folder
- A SHA256 checksum file to verify integrity

All releases are built automatically using **GitHub Actions**, a continuous integration system provided by GitHub. This ensures that the binaries are **consistently built** from the source code in the repository.

You can view the exact build process and logs by visiting:
üëâ [GitHub Actions for PrMers](https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers/actions)

This setup guarantees that even users without development tools can safely download and verify that the binaries match the public source code.

### üçè macOS: Allow Execution of the Binary

On macOS, running unsigned executables downloaded from the internet will trigger **Gatekeeper**, blocking the file by default.

If you see this error:

> ‚Äúprmers‚Äù cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

Follow these steps to allow it:

1. Attempt to run `prmers` once (via Terminal or double-click).
2. Open **System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General**.
3. At the bottom, you will see a message:
   > ‚Äúprmers‚Äù was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.
4. Click **"Allow Anyway"**.
5. Run the file again from Terminal:
   ```bash
   ./prmers
   ```
6. A dialog will appear asking for confirmation. Click **"Open"**.

‚úÖ The binary will now execute normally in the future.

#### (Optional) Local code signing

If you're a developer or wish to suppress some security warnings (e.g., `killed: 9`), you can locally self-sign the binary:

```bash
codesign -s - --deep --force --timestamp --options runtime ./prmers
```

> Note: This is *not* a notarized signature, but it may prevent runtime security blocks.

To distribute a notarized macOS app without this issue, an Apple Developer Account is required.

## Installation from sources

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers.git
   cd PrMers
2. **Compile the software:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Install the executable and kernel file:**
The following command installs the executable to /usr/local/bin and the OpenCL kernel file to /usr/local/share/prmers.
  ```bash
   sudo make install
  ```
The Makefile compiles the executable with a compile-time macro (KERNEL_PATH) so that, after installation, PrMers automatically finds its kernel file.

## Compilation
Once installed, you can run PrMers directly from the command line. The basic syntax is:
  ```bash
prmers <p> [options]
  ```
for example 
  ```bash
prmers 127 -O fastmath mad -c 16 -profile -ll -t 120 -f /your/backup/path
  ```



## Command-Line Options

- `<p>`: Minimum exponent to test (required)
- `-d <device_id>`: Specify the OpenCL device ID (default: 0)
- `-O <options>`: Enable OpenCL optimization flags (e.g., `fastmath`, `mad`, `unsafe`, `nans`, `optdisable`)
- `-c <localCarryPropagationDepth>`: Set the local carry propagation depth (default: 8)
- `-profile`: Enable kernel execution profiling
- `-prp`: Run in PRP mode (default), with an initial value of 3 and no execution of `kernel_sub2` (final result must equal 9)
- `-ll`: Run in Lucas‚ÄìLehmer mode, with an initial value of 4 and p-2 iterations of `kernel_sub2`
- `-t <backup_interval>`: Specify the backup interval in seconds (default: 60)
- `-f <path>`: Specify the directory path for saving/loading backup files (default: current directory)
- `-proof`: Enable proof generation (experimental). Produces `.proof` files for verification
- `-l1 <value>`: Force local size for the classic NTT kernel  
- `-l2 <value>`: Force local size for the 2-step radix-16 NTT kernel  
- `-l3 <value>`: Force local size for the mixed radix kernel (radix-4 + radix-2 + square + inverse)
- `--noask`: Automatically submit results to PrimeNet without prompting
- `-user <username>`: PrimeNet account username to use for automatic result submission

## Uninstallation
To uninstall PrMers, run:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Cleaning Up
To remove compiled files from the build directory, run:

```bash
make clean
```

# Ubuntu Setup for OpenCL Development

Below is an example of the commands you need to install the necessary components to compile C++ code with OpenCL support and to run PrMers on Ubuntu. This includes installing the OpenCL headers and ICD loader, as well as the GPU drivers for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install OpenCL development packages and tools
sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers clinfo

For NVIDIA GPUs 
Install the proprietary NVIDIA driver (adjust version as needed) along with its OpenCL ICD.

sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-525 nvidia-opencl-icd-525

For AMD GPUs 
Download the AMDGPU-PRO driver package from AMD's website.
Then install it with OpenCL support using the following command (run in the extracted directory):

./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal,legacy

For Intel GPUs 

sudo apt-get install intel-opencl-icd

Verify your OpenCL installation by running:
clinfo


## Another option for manual compilation
To compile:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -I. -o prmers prmers.cpp proof/common.cpp proof/proof.cpp proof/md5.cpp proof/sha3.cpp -lOpenCL -O3 -Wall
```

## Usage
Example of execution:
```bash
prmers 9279 -d 1
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 9279
Using OpenCL device ID: 1

Launching OpenCL kernel (p = 9279); computation may take a while depending on the exponent.
Max global workers possible: 256
Final workers count: 256
Progress: 100.00% | Elapsed: 11.09s | Iterations/sec: 836.78 | ETA: 0.00s       
M9279 is composite.
Kernel execution time: 11.09 seconds
Iterations per second: 836.77 (9277 iterations in total)
```

Or without specifying a device:
```bash
prmers 216091
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 216091
Using OpenCL device ID: 0

Launching OpenCL kernel (p = 216091); computation may take a while depending on the exponent.
Max global workers possible: 256
Final workers count: 256
Progress: 0.11% | Elapsed: 4.05s | Iterations/sec: 57.50 | ETA: 3754.28s
```

## Output Example

```bash
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 13
Using OpenCL device ID: 1

Launching OpenCL kernel (p_min_i = 13) without progress display; computation may take a while depending on the exponent.

Lucas-Lehmer test results:
Mp with p = 13 is a Mersenne prime.
Kernel execution time: 0.00150793 seconds
Iterations per second: 7294.76 (11 iterations in total)
 ```

## New Features

- **Modes:**
  - **-prp**: Run in PRP mode (default).  
    Sets the initial value to 3 and performs *p* iterations without executing kernel_sub2.  
    The final result must equal 9.
  - **-ll**: Run in Lucas-Lehmer mode.  
    Sets the initial value to 4 and performs *p-2* iterations, including the execution of kernel_sub2.

- **Backup / Save and Resume:**
  - The program periodically saves its state (the contents of buf_x) and the current loop iteration into files.
  - Use **-t \<backup_interval>** to specify the backup interval in seconds (default: 60 seconds).
  - Use **-f \<path>** to specify the directory for saving and loading files (default: current directory).
  - If backup files (for example, "127prp.mers" and "127prp.loop") exist in the specified path, the program will resume computation from the saved iteration.
  - During computation, when a backup occurs (either because the backup interval has elapsed or the user presses Ctrl-C), a status line is displayed with the same progress information as the normal progress display but in a distinct color (MAGENTA) and prefixed by "[Backup]".

## Proof Generation (Experimental)

This project includes an **experimental** implementation of proof generation for verifying Mersenne prime tests.  
The proof system is **heavily based on** the one used in [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl), with substantial code reuse.  

The proof process generates a `.proof` file, which contains:
- The final residue after all PRP iterations.
- A sequence of intermediate residues at exponentially spaced iteration points.
- A verification mechanism that ensures `B == A^(2^span) (mod 2^E - 1)`.

Currently, verification is **not fully stable** and needs further debugging.  
Performance is also significantly slower than GpuOwl, as optimizations are still in progress.

## Notes
- The code uses OpenCL for GPU acceleration.
- It implements both PRP and Lucas-Lehmer (LL) tests.
- State saving is performed periodically based on the backup interval.
- When interrupted (Ctrl-C), the program saves its state before exiting, allowing you to resume later.
- The project implements an integer-based NTT and IBDWT using modular arithmetic modulo 2^64 - 2^32 + 1.
- The chosen modulus enables fast modular reduction using only bit shifts and additions.
