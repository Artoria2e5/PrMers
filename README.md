# PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne Primality Test

PrMers is a high-performance GPU application for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers using the Lucas‚ÄìLehmer and PRP (Probable Prime) algorithms. It leverages OpenCL and Number Theoretic Transforms (NTT) for fast large-integer arithmetic, and is optimized for long-running computations.

Key features:
- ‚ö° GPU acceleration using OpenCL (including legacy OpenCL 1.2 devices)
- üîÅ Automatic checkpointing with resume support
- üì§ Submit results directly to your [mersenne.org](https://www.mersenne.org/) PrimeNet account
- üñ•Ô∏è Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (build from source or use precompiled binaries)
- üìä Benchmark output for performance comparison across devices

`prmers` supports [P‚àí1 factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_p_%E2%88%92_1_algorithm) stage 1, a powerful algorithm to find a prime factor \( q \) of a Mersenne number \( 2^p - 1 \), provided that \( q - 1 \) is composed entirely of small prime factors.

## P-1 Factoring with `prmers`


`prmers` supports [P‚àí1 factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_p_%E2%88%92_1_algorithm) stage 1, a powerful algorithm to find a prime factor \( q \) of a Mersenne number \( 2^p - 1 \), provided that \( q - 1 \) is composed entirely of small prime factors.

A factor \( q \) of \( 2^p - 1 \) must satisfy \( q \equiv 1 \mod 2p \), i.e. \( q = 2kp + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). The P‚àí1 method will find such a factor if \( k \) is B1-smooth ‚Äî meaning all its prime divisors are less than a chosen bound \( B_1 \).

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Choose a smoothness bound \( B_1 \)
2. Build an exponent \( E = \text{lcm}(1, 2, \ldots, B_1) \)
3. Compute \( x = 3^{E \cdot 2p} \mod (2^p - 1) \)
4. Compute \( \gcd(x - 1, 2^p - 1) \)

If the result is a nontrivial factor, the algorithm succeeds.

To run a stage-1 P‚àí1 factoring test on exponent 541 with bound B1 = 8099:

```bash
./prmers 541 -pm1 -b1 8099
```

Sample output if a factor is found:

```
Start a P-1 factoring stage 1 up to B1=8099
GCD(x - 1, 2^541 - 1) = 4312790327
P-1 factor stage 1 found: 4312790327
```

If no factor is found up to the chosen bound, the program reports:
```
No P-1 factor up to B1=8099
```

This stage-1 P‚àí1 test is GPU-accelerated using optimized NTT-based exponentiation modulo \( 2^n - 1 \).

# üìÑ worktodo.txt support

This program now supports reading assignments from a `worktodo.txt` file, similar to how Prime95 or other GIMPS tools operate.

## ‚úÖ Supported format

Only lines beginning with the `PRP=` prefix are currently supported.

Each `PRP=` line follows this format:

PRP=assignment_id,k,b,n,c[,how_far_factored,tests_saved][,known_factors]

Where:
- `k √ó b‚Åø + c` defines the number to test.
- For Mersenne numbers, this is typically: `k=1`, `b=2`, `c=-1`.
- `n` is the exponent (this is the value your program will extract and test).
- Other fields are optional and currently ignored.

### üìå Example
PRP=DEADBEEFCAFEBABEDEADBEEFCAFEBABE,1,2,197493337,-1,76,0;

This line instructs the program to test the Mersenne number \( 2^{197493337} - 1 \).

## üîç Usage

You can either:
- Provide the exponent manually on the command line:

```bash
./prmers 197493337
```

Or use a worktodo.txt file (default path: ./worktodo.txt):

./prmers -worktodo

Or specify a custom path to your worktodo file:

./prmers -worktodo /path/to/worktodo.txt

If no exponent is passed and no -worktodo is provided, the program will prompt you to enter one interactively.

Note: Only the first valid PRP= line is used for now. Multi-line batching may be added later.


## üîß Using a Configuration File (`-config`)

You can run `prmers` using a configuration file to avoid passing long arguments on the command line every time.

### üìÑ Example `setting.cfg`

```txt
-d 1
-O fastmath mad
-c 16
-profile
-ll
-t 300
-f /home/user/checkpoints
-l1 256
-l2 128
-l3 64
--noask
-user myusername
-worktodo ./tasks/worktodo.txt
```

### üöÄ How to use

You can launch `prmers` with this configuration file using:

```bash
./prmers -config ./setting.cfg
```

This will load all the parameters listed in `setting.cfg` as if you had typed them directly on the command line.

### üìå Supported use cases

- ‚úÖ If an exponent is **given on the command line**, it takes priority:
  
  ```bash
  ./prmers 333 -config ./setting.cfg
  ```

- ‚úÖ If **no exponent is given**, but `-worktodo <path>` is present (in config or command line), the exponent is read from the `worktodo.txt` file:

  ```bash
  ./prmers -config ./setting.cfg
  # ‚Üí uses the exponent found in tasks/worktodo.txt
  ```

- ‚úÖ If no exponent and no valid `worktodo.txt` entry are found, the program will **prompt you to enter the exponent manually**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The config file must contain arguments **exactly as they would be typed on the command line**, space-separated.
- You can still override values from the config file by passing extra arguments on the command line.


## üîê Submitting Results to PrimeNet

PrMers supports direct submission of results to [PrimeNet](https://www.mersenne.org) using your personal account. If you don‚Äôt have an account yet, it‚Äôs free and quick to create one at:  
üëâ **https://www.mersenne.org**

After a test completes, PrMers will prompt you to submit your result to PrimeNet:

```
‚úÖ JSON result written to: ./86243_prp_result.json
Do you want to send the result to PrimeNet (https://www.mersenne.org) ? (y/n): y
Enter your PrimeNet username (Don't have an account? Create one at https://www.mersenne.org)
Enter your PrimeNet username : cherubrock
Enter your PrimeNet password:

‚úÖ Server response:...

üìù Parsed PrimeNet Result Summary:

Skipped 0 lines already in the database. 
Accepted 1 lines.
```

Once accepted, the result is marked as sent:

```
‚úÖ Result successfully sent to PrimeNet.
```

If for any reason a result was not submitted (e.g. skipped, disconnected, closed), PrMers will automatically prompt you to re-submit the result later on launch.

```bash
Found unsent result: ./86243_prp_result.json
Do you want to submit it to PrimeNet now? (y/n)
```

This ensures **you never lose credit** for a completed computation.


## üíæ Download Precompiled Binaries (Linux, Windows & macOS)

You can download **precompiled binaries** for **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS** directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers/releases).

Each release contains:
- A compiled executable: `prmers` (Linux/macOS) or `prmers.exe` (Windows)
- Required OpenCL kernel files inside a `kernels/` folder
- A SHA256 checksum file to verify integrity

All releases are built automatically using **GitHub Actions**, a continuous integration system provided by GitHub. This ensures that the binaries are **consistently built** from the source code in the repository.

You can view the exact build process and logs by visiting:
üëâ [GitHub Actions for PrMers](https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers/actions)

This setup guarantees that even users without development tools can safely download and verify that the binaries match the public source code.

### üçè macOS: Allow Execution of the Binary

On macOS, running unsigned executables downloaded from the internet will trigger **Gatekeeper**, blocking the file by default.

If you see this error:

> ‚Äúprmers‚Äù cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

Follow these steps to allow it:

1. Attempt to run `prmers` once (via Terminal or double-click).
2. Open **System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General**.
3. At the bottom, you will see a message:
   > ‚Äúprmers‚Äù was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.
4. Click **"Allow Anyway"**.
5. Run the file again from Terminal:
   ```bash
   ./prmers
   ```
6. A dialog will appear asking for confirmation. Click **"Open"**.

‚úÖ The binary will now execute normally in the future.

#### (Optional) Local code signing

If you're a developer or wish to suppress some security warnings (e.g., `killed: 9`), you can locally self-sign the binary:

```bash
codesign -s - --deep --force --timestamp --options runtime ./prmers
```

> Note: This is *not* a notarized signature, but it may prevent runtime security blocks.

To distribute a notarized macOS app without this issue, an Apple Developer Account is required.

## Installation from sources

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cherubrock-seb/PrMers.git
   cd PrMers
2. **Compile the software:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Install the executable and kernel file:**
The following command installs the executable to /usr/local/bin and the OpenCL kernel file to /usr/local/share/prmers.
  ```bash
   sudo make install
  ```
The Makefile compiles the executable with a compile-time macro (KERNEL_PATH) so that, after installation, PrMers automatically finds its kernel file.

## Compilation
Once installed, you can run PrMers directly from the command line. The basic syntax is:
  ```bash
prmers <p> [options]
  ```
for example 
  ```bash
prmers 127 -O fastmath mad -c 16 -profile -ll -t 120 -f /your/backup/path
  ```

# üõ†Ô∏è Building PrMers on Windows (Manual Instructions)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: **MinGW / MSYS2 + Makefile**

### 1. Install MSYS2: [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/)

### 2. Update MSYS2:
```sh
pacman -Syu
```

---

### 3. Install required packages:
```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-opencl-icd-loader mingw-w64-x86_64-curl
```

---

### 4. Build using Makefile:

## üéâ DONE!
You should now have `prmers.exe` ready to run!

## Command-Line Options

- `<p>`: Minimum exponent to test (required)
- `-d <device_id>`: Specify the OpenCL device ID (default: 0)
- `-O <options>`: Enable OpenCL optimization flags (e.g., `fastmath`, `mad`, `unsafe`, `nans`, `optdisable`)
- `-c <localCarryPropagationDepth>`: Set the local carry propagation depth (default: 8)
- `-profile`: Enable kernel execution profiling
- `-prp`: Run in PRP mode (default), with an initial value of 3 and no execution of `kernel_sub2` (final result must equal 9)
- `-ll`: Run in Lucas‚ÄìLehmer mode, with an initial value of 4 and p-2 iterations of `kernel_sub2`
- `-t <backup_interval>`: Specify the backup interval in seconds (default: 60)
- `-f <path>`: Specify the directory path for saving/loading backup files (default: current directory)
- `-enqueue_max <value>`: Manually set the maximum number of enqueued kernels before `clFinish` is called (default: autodetect)
- `--noask`: Automatically submit results to PrimeNet without prompting
- `-user <username>`: PrimeNet account username to use for automatic result submission
- `-computer <computername>`: computer name to use for PrimeNet result submission
- `password <password>` : PrimeNet account password (used only when -no-ask is set, used to automatically put the result in primenet without prompt).
- `-worktodo [path]`: Use a `worktodo.txt` file to load an exponent automatically.
  - If no path is given, the default `./worktodo.txt` is used.
  - Only the first valid `PRP=` line is processed.
- `-config <path>`: Load configuration from a specified `.cfg` file instead of passing options manually


üìå Typical Usage Scenarios

This program is designed for flexible, automated testing of Mersenne numbers using OpenCL. The most common use case involves running multiple tests in sequence using a `worktodo.txt` file, with automatic result submission enabled:

- You can specify a list of exponents in `worktodo.txt` and run the program with `--noask`, `-user <username>`, and `-password <password>` to automatically submit results to PrimeNet without interaction.
- For advanced control, backup files can be stored at a custom path using `-f`, and fine-grained OpenCL settings like local sizes or profiling can be adjusted with `-l1`, `-l2`, `-l3`, or `-profile`.
- Command-line overrides (`-O`, `-c`, etc.) allow tailoring the run for performance tuning or testing alternative kernel behaviors.
- You may also run single tests manually by specifying the exponent as a positional argument.

This enables full automation on servers or multi-GPU rigs with minimal supervision.



## Uninstallation
To uninstall PrMers, run:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Cleaning Up
To remove compiled files from the build directory, run:

```bash
make clean
```

# Ubuntu Setup for OpenCL Development

Below is an example of the commands you need to install the necessary components to compile C++ code with OpenCL support and to run PrMers on Ubuntu. This includes installing the OpenCL headers and ICD loader, as well as the GPU drivers for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install OpenCL development packages and tools
sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers clinfo

For NVIDIA GPUs 
Install the proprietary NVIDIA driver (adjust version as needed) along with its OpenCL ICD.

sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-525 nvidia-opencl-icd-525

For AMD GPUs 
Download the AMDGPU-PRO driver package from AMD's website.
Then install it with OpenCL support using the following command (run in the extracted directory):

./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal,legacy

For Intel GPUs 

sudo apt-get install intel-opencl-icd

Verify your OpenCL installation by running:
clinfo


## Another option for manual compilation
To compile:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -I. -o prmers prmers.cpp proof/common.cpp proof/proof.cpp proof/md5.cpp proof/sha3.cpp -lOpenCL -O3 -Wall
```

## Usage
Example of execution:
```bash
prmers 9279 -d 1
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 9279
Using OpenCL device ID: 1

Launching OpenCL kernel (p = 9279); computation may take a while depending on the exponent.
Max global workers possible: 256
Final workers count: 256
Progress: 100.00% | Elapsed: 11.09s | Iterations/sec: 836.78 | ETA: 0.00s       
M9279 is composite.
Kernel execution time: 11.09 seconds
Iterations per second: 836.77 (9277 iterations in total)
```

Or without specifying a device:
```bash
prmers 216091
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 216091
Using OpenCL device ID: 0

Launching OpenCL kernel (p = 216091); computation may take a while depending on the exponent.
Max global workers possible: 256
Final workers count: 256
Progress: 0.11% | Elapsed: 4.05s | Iterations/sec: 57.50 | ETA: 3754.28s
```

## Output Example

```bash
PrMers: GPU-accelerated Mersenne primality test (OpenCL, NTT, Lucas-Lehmer)
Testing exponent: 13
Using OpenCL device ID: 1

Launching OpenCL kernel (p_min_i = 13) without progress display; computation may take a while depending on the exponent.

Lucas-Lehmer test results:
Mp with p = 13 is a Mersenne prime.
Kernel execution time: 0.00150793 seconds
Iterations per second: 7294.76 (11 iterations in total)
 ```

## New Features

- **Modes:**
  - **-prp**: Run in PRP mode (default).  
    Sets the initial value to 3 and performs *p* iterations without executing kernel_sub2.  
    The final result must equal 9.
  - **-ll**: Run in Lucas-Lehmer mode.  
    Sets the initial value to 4 and performs *p-2* iterations, including the execution of kernel_sub2.

- **Backup / Save and Resume:**
  - The program periodically saves its state (the contents of buf_x) and the current loop iteration into files.
  - Use **-t \<backup_interval>** to specify the backup interval in seconds (default: 60 seconds).
  - Use **-f \<path>** to specify the directory for saving and loading files (default: current directory).
  - If backup files (for example, "127prp.mers" and "127prp.loop") exist in the specified path, the program will resume computation from the saved iteration.
  - During computation, when a backup occurs (either because the backup interval has elapsed or the user presses Ctrl-C), a status line is displayed with the same progress information as the normal progress display but in a distinct color (MAGENTA) and prefixed by "[Backup]".

## Proof Generation (Experimental)

This project includes an **experimental** implementation of proof generation for verifying Mersenne prime tests.  
The proof system is **heavily based on** the one used in [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl), with substantial code reuse.  

The proof process generates a `.proof` file, which contains:
- The final residue after all PRP iterations.
- A sequence of intermediate residues at exponentially spaced iteration points.
- A verification mechanism that ensures `B == A^(2^span) (mod 2^E - 1)`.

Currently, verification is **not fully stable** and needs further debugging.  
Performance is also significantly slower than GpuOwl, as optimizations are still in progress.

## Notes
- The code uses OpenCL for GPU acceleration.
- It implements both PRP and Lucas-Lehmer (LL) tests.
- State saving is performed periodically based on the backup interval.
- When interrupted (Ctrl-C), the program saves its state before exiting, allowing you to resume later.
- The project implements an integer-based NTT and IBDWT using modular arithmetic modulo 2^64 - 2^32 + 1.
- The chosen modulus enables fast modular reduction using only bit shifts and additions.
